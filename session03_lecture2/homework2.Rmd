# Data Visualisation - Exploration

Now that you've demonstrated your software is setup, and you have the basics of data manipulation, the goal of this assignment is to practice transforming, visualising, and exploring data.

# Mass shootings in the US

In July 2012, in the aftermath of a mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/) published a report on mass shootings in the United States since 1982. Importantly, they provided the underlying data set as [an open-source database](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) for anyone interested in studying and understanding this criminal behavior.

## Obtain the data

## Explore the data

### Specific questions

-   Generate a data frame that summarizes the number of mass shootings per year.

```{r}

mass_shootings_yr <- mass_shootings %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% arrange(desc(year))

skimr::skim(mass_shootings)
```

-   Generate a bar chart that identifies the number of mass shooters associated with each race category. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest and each bar should show its number.

```{r}


mass_shootings %>% mutate(race= case_when(
  is.na(race)   ~ "Unknown", .default = race )) %>%  group_by(race) %>%  summarise(n=n()) %>%   mutate(race = fct_reorder(race,n)) %>% arrange(race) %>% ggplot(aes(x = n, y = race)) +
  geom_col() +
  # add n to each bar
  geom_text(
    aes(label = n, x = n - .25),
    colour = "white",
    size = 5,
    hjust = 1
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16))+
  labs(
    title = "US Shootings Count by Race 1982-2021",
    x= "number of shootings",
    y = NULL)+

  # ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")

```

-   Generate a boxplot visualizing the number of total victims, by type of location.

IK: Pls note that the boxplot requires a continuous entry in one of parameters since it plots distribution parameters. I assume  "total" means distribution.  

```{r}

# The base boxplot with linear y-axis scale
mass_shootings %>%   ggplot(aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16))+
  labs(
    title = "Victims Count in US Shootings by Location Type 1982-2021",
    x= "Location Type",
    y = NULL)+

  # ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
  

# The base boxplot with log2 y-axis scale
mass_shootings %>%   ggplot(aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
 scale_y_continuous(trans="log2") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16))+
  labs(
    title = "Victims Count in US Shootings by Location Type 1982-2021",
    x= "Location Type",
    y = NULL)+

  # ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")

```

-   Redraw the same plot, but remove the Las Vegas Strip massacre from the dataset.

```{r}

# The base boxplot with linear y-axis scale
mass_shootings %>%  filter(case != "Las Vegas Strip massacre") %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16))+
  labs(
    title = "Victims Count in US Shootings by Location Type 1982-2021",
    caption = "Las Vegas Strip massacre is omitted",
    x= "Location Type",
    y = NULL)+

  # ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
  

```

### More open-ended questions

Address the following questions. Generate appropriate figures/tables to support your conclusions.

-   How many white males with prior signs of mental illness initiated a mass shooting after 2000?

IK: there were 22 such incidents 
```{r}
mass_shootings %>%  filter(race == "White",male,prior_mental_illness=="Yes",year >2000 )  %>% count()

```

-   Which month of the year has the most mass shootings? Generate a bar chart sorted in chronological (natural) order (Jan-Feb-Mar- etc) to provide evidence of your answer.

```{r}


mass_shootings  %>%  group_by(month) %>%  summarise(n=n()) %>%    mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.abb) ) %>% arrange(month)  %>%  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = n)) + geom_col() +
  # add n to each bar
  geom_text(
    aes(label = n, y = n - .5),
    colour = "white",
    size = 5,
    hjust = 0.5
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16))+
  labs(
    title = "US Shootings Count by Month 1982-2021",
    y= "number of shootings",
    x = NULL)+

  # ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")

# mutate(race = fct_reorder(race,n)) %>%

```

-   How does the distribution of mass shooting fatalities differ between White and Black shooters? What about White and Latino shooters?

IK: 
- It appears that shootings where the perpetrator was white claim more fatalities on average and the distribution has longer tails with many outliers

```{r}


# The base boxplot with log2 y-axis scale
mass_shootings %>%  filter(race %in% c("White","Black","Latino") ) %>%   
 ggplot(aes(x = race, y = fatalities )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
   scale_y_continuous(trans="log2") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16)) +
  labs(title = "Fatalities in US Shootings by Race 1982-2021",
    x= "Race",
    y = NULL) +
# ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
  

```

### Very open-ended

-   Are mass shootings with shooters suffering from mental illness different from mass shootings with no signs of mental illness in the shooter?

IK: There are more mass shooting commited by mentally ill ppl but there are also a lot of missing obs. 
It seems like the number of victims and fatalities is somewhat higher whem perpetrator is mentally ill but the difference would not be statistically significant. 

```{r}

# The base boxplot with log2 y-axis scale
mass_shootings %>% group_by(prior_mental_illness) %>% count()

# Checging fatalities
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = prior_mental_illness, y = fatalities )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
   scale_y_continuous(trans="log2") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16)) +
  labs(title = "Fatalities in US Shootings by Mental Condition 1982-2021",
    x= "Did perpetrator have mental illnes",
    y = NULL) +
# ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")


# Checging total_victims
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = prior_mental_illness, y = total_victims )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
   scale_y_continuous(trans="log2") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16)) +
  labs(title = "Victims in US Shootings by Mental Condition 1982-2021",
    x= "Did perpetrator have mental illnes",
    y = NULL) +
# ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")


# creating a total count of mental illness for rations
mass_shootings_ill <- mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>%  group_by(prior_mental_illness) %>% summarise(illness_total = n())
mass_shootings <- left_join(x=mass_shootings,y=mass_shootings_ill,by ='prior_mental_illness' )


# Checging by race
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% arrange(race,prior_mental_illness) %>%  group_by(race,prior_mental_illness) %>% count()
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% arrange(prior_mental_illness,race) %>%  group_by(prior_mental_illness,race) %>% summarise(n=n(),illness_total=mean(illness_total)) %>% mutate(proportion = n/illness_total)


# Checging by location type
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% arrange(prior_mental_illness,location_type) %>%  group_by(prior_mental_illness,location_type) %>% summarise(n=n(),illness_total=mean(illness_total)) %>% mutate(proportion = n/illness_total)

# Checging fatalities
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% group_by(prior_mental_illness) %>%  summarise(mean_age = mean(age_of_shooter))

# dropping added variable
mass_shootings = select(mass_shootings, -illness_total)

```

-   Assess the relationship between mental illness and total victims, mental illness and location type, and the intersection of all three variables.

IK: the number of victims seems to be somewhat larger when the suspect is mentally ill. The number of victims in schools in noticably larger on average when the suspect is mentally ill.


```{r}

# creating a total count of mental illness for rations
mass_shootings_ill <- mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>%  group_by(prior_mental_illness) %>% summarise(illness_total = n())
mass_shootings <- left_join(x=mass_shootings,y=mass_shootings_ill,by ='prior_mental_illness' )


# Checging total_victims

# Checging by location type count
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% arrange(location_type,prior_mental_illness) %>%  group_by(location_type,prior_mental_illness) %>% count()

# Checging by location type proportion relative to illness status
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% arrange(prior_mental_illness,location_type) %>%  group_by(prior_mental_illness,location_type) %>% summarise(n=n(),illness_total=mean(illness_total)) %>% mutate(proportion = n/illness_total)



# Checging total_victims by mental_illness and 
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x =  location_type, y = total_victims, fill= prior_mental_illness)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
   scale_y_continuous(trans="log2") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16)) +
  labs(title = "Victims in US Shootings by Mental Condition and Location 1982-2021",
    x= "Location Type",
    y = NULL) +
# ensure title is top-left aligned

# dropping added variable
mass_shootings = select(mass_shootings, -illness_total)

```

Make sure to provide a couple of sentences of written interpretation of your tables/figures. Graphs and tables alone will not be sufficient to answer this question.

# Exploring credit card fraud

We will be using a dataset with credit card transactions containing legitimate and fraud transactions. Fraud is typically well below 1% of all transactions, so a naive model that predicts that all transactions are legitimate and not fraudulent would have an accuracy of well over 99%-- pretty good, no? (well, not quite as we will see later in the course)

You can read more on credit card fraud on [Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Weighted Support Vector Machine](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=105944)

The dataset we will use consists of credit card transactions and it includes information about each transaction including customer details, the merchant and category of purchase, and whether or not the transaction was a fraud.

## Obtain the data

The dataset is too large to be hosted on Canvas or Github, so please download it from dropbox https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q1yk8mmnbbrzavl/AAAxzRtIhag9Nc_hODafGV2ka?dl=0 and save it in your `dsb` repo, under the `data` folder

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

card_fraud <- read_csv(here::here("data", "card_fraud.csv"))

glimpse(card_fraud)
```

The data dictionary is as follows

| column(variable)      | description                                 |

-   In this dataset, how likely are fraudulent transactions? Generate a table that summarizes the number and frequency of fraudulent transactions per year.

```{r}

card_fraud %>% mutate(total = n()) %>% group_by(is_fraud) %>% summarise(n=n(),total=mean(total)) %>% mutate(frac_fraud = n/total)  %>% select(frac_fraud, n)


```

-   How much money (in US\$ terms) are fraudulent transactions costing the company? Generate a table that summarizes the total amount of legitimate and fraudulent transactions per year and calculate the % of fraudulent transactions, in US\$ terms.

```{r}

card_fraud %>% group_by(trans_year) %>%  mutate(total = mean(amt)*n()) %>%  ungroup() %>% group_by(trans_year,is_fraud) %>% summarise(by_type_amt=sum(amt),total=mean(total)) %>% mutate(frac_fraud_amt = by_type_amt/total) %>% select(frac_fraud_amt, by_type_amt)

```

-   Generate a histogram that shows the distribution of amounts charged to credit card, both for legitimate and fraudulent accounts. Also, for both types of transactions, calculate some quick summary statistics.

```{r}

card_fraud %>% mutate(is_fraud = factor(is_fraud) ) %>% ggplot(aes(x =  amt, fill= is_fraud, color=is_fraud)) +
  geom_density(position="identity") +

```

-   What types of purchases are most likely to be instances of fraud? Consider category of merchants and produce a bar chart that shows % of total fraudulent transactions sorted in order.

```{r}

card_fraud %>%   filter(is_fraud==1) %>% mutate(total = mean(amt)*n()) %>%  group_by(category) %>%   summarise(total_by_category = sum(amt),total=mean(total)) %>%  mutate(frac_fraud_by_cat = round(total_by_category/total,3)) %>% arrange(desc(frac_fraud_by_cat)) %>% mutate(category = fct_reorder(category,frac_fraud_by_cat)) %>%  ggplot(aes(x = frac_fraud_by_cat, y = category)) +

```

-   When is fraud more prevalent? Which days, months, hours? To create new variables to help you in your analysis, we use the `lubridate` package and the following code

IK: Sunday and Monday are the most popular days. May and March are the post popular month, From midnight to 3am are the most popular hours for the fraud.

```         
mutate(
  date_only = lubridate::date(trans_date_trans_time),
  month_name = lubridate::month(trans_date_trans_time, label=TRUE),
  hour = lubridate::hour(trans_date_trans_time),
  weekday = lubridate::wday(trans_date_trans_time, label = TRUE)
  )
```

-   Are older customers significantly more likely to be victims of credit card fraud? To calculate a customer's age, we use the `lubridate` package and the following code

IK: More senior ppl are more likely to be the target of credit card fraud.

```         
  mutate(
   age = interval(dob, trans_date_trans_time) / years(1),
    )
```

```{r}

# creating nesessary variables
card_fraud <- card_fraud %>% mutate(

-   Is fraud related to distance? The distance between a card holder's home and the location of the transaction can be a feature that is related to fraud. To calculate distance, we need the latidue/longitude of card holders's home and the latitude/longitude of the transaction, and we will use the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) to calculate distance. I adapted code to [calculate distance between two points on earth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-distance-two-points-earth/amp/) which you can find below

```{r}
# distance between card holder's home and transaction
# code adapted from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-distance-two-points-earth/amp/


card_fraud <- card_fraud %>%
  mutate(
    
    # convert latitude/longitude to radians
    lat1_radians = lat / 57.29577951,
    lat2_radians = merch_lat / 57.29577951,
    long1_radians = long / 57.29577951,
    long2_radians = merch_long / 57.29577951,
    
    # calculate distance in miles
    distance_miles = 3963.0 * acos((sin(lat1_radians) * sin(lat2_radians)) + cos(lat1_radians) * cos(lat2_radians) * cos(long2_radians - long1_radians)),

    # calculate distance in km
    distance_km = 6377.830272 * acos((sin(lat1_radians) * sin(lat2_radians)) + cos(lat1_radians) * cos(lat2_radians) * cos(long2_radians - long1_radians))

  )

```

Plot a boxplot or a violin plot that looks at the relationship of distance and `is_fraud`. Does distance seem to be a useful feature in explaining fraud?

IK: Distance does not seem to play a role.

```{r}

card_fraud %>%    mutate(is_fraud=factor(is_fraud)) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = distance_km, y = is_fraud )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
   scale_x_continuous(trans="log2") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16)) +
  labs(title = "Distance for Legitimate and Fraudilent Transactoins",
    y= "Is it a fraud",
    x = NULL) +
# ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")

# Exploring sources of electricity production, CO2 emissions, and GDP per capita.

There are many sources of data on how countries generate their electricity and their CO2 emissions. I would like you to create three graphs:

## 1. A stacked area chart that shows how your own country generated its electricity since 2000.

You will use

`geom_area(colour="grey90", alpha = 0.5, position = "fill")`

## 2. A scatter plot that looks at how CO2 per capita and GDP per capita are related

## 3. A scatter plot that looks at how electricity usage (kWh) per capita/day GDP per capita are related

We will get energy data from the Our World in Data website, and CO2 and GDP per capita emissions from the World Bank, using the `wbstats`package.

Specific questions:

1.  How would you turn `energy` to long, tidy format?
2.  You may need to join these data frames
    -   Use `left_join` from `dplyr` to [join the tables](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html)
    -   To complete the merge, you need a unique *key* to match observations between the data frames. Country names may not be consistent among the three dataframes, so please use the 3-digit ISO code for each country
    -   An aside: There is a great package called [`countrycode`](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/countrycode) that helps solve the problem of inconsistent country names (Is it UK? United Kingdom? Great Britain?). `countrycode()` takes as an input a country's name in a specific format and outputs it using whatever format you specify.
3.  Write a function that takes as input any country's name and returns all three graphs. You can use the `patchwork` package to arrange the three graphs as shown below



```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "electricity-co2-gdp.png"), error = FALSE)
```

# Rubric

13/13: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
